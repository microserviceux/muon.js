# Muon JS

Muon in the browser.

See http://muoncore.io for more information on muon

## Getting Started

To test drive muon.js, you can run the demo application.  This starts a gateway, and demonstrates the capabilities coming from running muon in the browser.

```
make run
```

Visit http://localhost:5000 for a running muon instance in the browser. It is given full permissions to communicate with the local muon environment.

Start a few other muon services, especially event services, such as Photon.

## Adding to your application

You will need to implement both a server side gateway, and a client browser application.

### Gateway

See the existing gateway.

### Client

Muon.js is published to NPM. Include it into your application using require and use a packager, such as browserify or webpack to transpile it into
your application code.

Then, include it as normal.
