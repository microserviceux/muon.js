# Muon JS

Muon in the browser.

See http://muoncore.io for more information on muon

## Getting Started

To test drive muon.js, you can run the demo application.  This starts a gateway, and demonstrates the capabilities coming from running muon in the browser.

```
make
make run
```

Visit http://localhost:5000 for a running muon instance in the browser. It is given full permissions to communicate with the local muon environment.

Start a few other muon services, especially event services, such as Photon.

## Adding to your application

You will need to implement both a server side gateway, and a client browser application.

### Gateway

See the existing gateway.  The only currently supported server side setup is node.js with Express.

```
var http = require("http")
var express = require("express")
var app = express()
var port = process.env.PORT || 5000
app.use(express.static("./test/server"))
var server = http.createServer(app)
server.listen(port)

var Muon = require("muon-core"); // <1>

var muon = Muon.create("browser-gateway", process.env.MUON_URL || "amqp://muon:microservices@localhost"); // <2>
var muonjs = require("muon.js").gateway(server, muon) // <3>
```
<1> Import Muon Core.
<2> Create a new Muon service, the local gateway. This will be used to communicate with the rest of the system
<3> Create a Muon.js browser gateway. Muon browser clients will communicate with this.

That's it!

### Client

Muon.js is published to NPM. Include it into your application using require and use a packager, such as browserify or webpack to transpile it into
your application code.

Here is a minimal browser javascript script.

This instantiates a muon instance, which will connect to the gateway you created above.

```
var muon = require("muon.js").client()  // <1>

setInterval(function(){
    var then = new Date().getTime();
    muon.request("rpc://myservice/endpoint", {"message": "BE AWESOME"}, function(resp) {  <2>
        var now = new Date().getTime();
        logger.info("Latency = " + (now - then))
        console.dir(resp)   //<3>
    });
}, 2000)
```
<1> Instantiate a muon.js client. This auto connects to the gateway using websockets.
<2> Every two seconds, make an rpc request to _myservice_ 
<3> Process the response, logging it to the browser javascript console.

You will need to process this into something you can import, using browserify or webpack.
